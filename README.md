The [Frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) format is used by Obsidian as metadata for files and is also supported by the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, allowing you to build queries for your contacts.

> :warning: **Do not change or remove `type` field**. It is used to detect if the current file is a contact.

> :warning: **It needs to be placed at the very top of the file**. Be very careful here!
